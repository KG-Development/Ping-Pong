# Ping Pong

Pong made by Gabriel and me, we are programming it in our free time. Just to make it clear: don't expect us do push every day, some days we don't have free time.

## What is working right now:

* Basic I/O
* Basic playing field
* functioning random ball movement 
* functioning collision detection
* Basic render engine
* Basic game loop
