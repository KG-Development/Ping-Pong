# Ping Pong

Pong made by Gabriel and me, we are programming it in our free time. Just to make it clear: don't expect us do push every day, some days we don't have free time.
PROJECT stopped, as the console can not handle that much objects at the same time moving around, we decided to stop the project. We will do it with SFML properly with GUI. You will soon see how that looks.

## What is working right now:

* Basic I/O
* Basic playing field
* functioning random ball movement 
* functioning collision detection
* Basic render engine
* Basic game loop
